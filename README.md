# QuizApp
A quiz application created with ReactJS as a Final Solo Project of Bob Ziroll's "Learn React for Free".

As a beginner in software development, this project built from scratch was a major challenge. Rendering components on the screen is not difficult, but figuring how the data should flow (and what data each component needs) is the tricky bit. 

Version History
1.0 (26 Nov 2021)
- Game will crash if user clicks on "Start Quiz!" too fast, due to imcomplete API call which causes downstream components to not render correctly, hence the crash.
- Once "Check Answers" is clicked, improvements can be made to highlight the correct/incorrect options in green/red.
- Clicking "New Game" can render a new Quiz page, instead of "restarting" the application.
